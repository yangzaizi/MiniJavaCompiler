It is done as part of course project for Comp520 Compiler at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. \r\n\r\nTo run the program, use the following steps:\r\n\r\n1) javac miniJava/Compiler.java\r\n2) java miniJava/Compiler program1.java (where program1.java is a miniJava program)\r\n\r\nBy end of step 2, if the program1.java file have any syntatical or contexual analysis erros, the program would output\r\nthese errors. The contexual analysis error starts with \"***\".\r\n\r\nIf there is no syntatical or contexual analysis error, step 2) would produce an program1.mJAM and program1.asm file.\r\nThe program1.mJAM is the object code which will be interpreted. Please follow the next few steps\r\n\r\n3) javac mJAM/Interpreter.java\r\n4) java mJAM/Interpreter program1.mJAM\r\n\r\nStep 4) would interpret the mJAM object code. Any result of println would starts with \">>>\".\r\n\r\nSome sample valid MiniJava program is provided in the Testcase directory\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are the limitation of MiniJava compiler: \r\n\r\n1)\tNo constructer is supported\r\n2)\tNo method overloading is supported\r\n3)\tNo inheritance or interface is supported\r\n4)\tNull value is syntactically not allowed\r\n5)\tStatic fields cannot be initialized\r\n6)\tFor loops are not supported\r\n7)\tNo user-defined class System\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
